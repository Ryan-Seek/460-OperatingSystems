6. at Rgetc() -> key pressed in kbd. 5. program has to get the char that was pressed
5. at while(data == 0) ->kbd loads the register of the interrupt address
1. ----------> 2. interrupt is generated
2. ----------> 3. The interrupt handler is called when an interrupt is generated.  This gets the scancode from the KBD data port.
3. at kbd.handler() -> turns scancode into actual ASCII then puts the char into the buf
4. ---> 2. ----> 5. descends down call stack
5. at return c -> 6. there is a char in the buf that we need to return, this is because data != 0
